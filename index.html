                <h2>Why I Want To Join Get Coding</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>I first started coding in my early teens building some (I imagine pretty terrible) websites on Geocities (#RIP) with just HTML.</li>
                    <li>Since then, I've worked for two Canadian tech companies. I spent a lot of time with the developers at both places and came to really appreciate the art of building great software.</li>
                    <li>Off and on since 2016, I've tried to teach myself code using platforms Codecademy and Codewars, but I can never seem to stick with it long-term.</li>
                    <li>I've built my <a href="https://alexsmeall.ca/" target="_blank">own website</a> using WordPress and helped build <a href="https://www.clinicalresearchdental.com/" target="_blank">this one</a> on Shopify at my previous company. I got to flex some technical skills doing both, and now I want to go deeper!</li>
